	<h1>Budget Balance Incentive</h1>
	</br>

	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<p>
		The United States of America is over 28 Trillion in Debt!  This Debt level is increasing and threatens our country becoming insolvent.  Our country could be considered the poorest in world history - no other courtry has been 28 Trillion in debt!
	</p>
	</br>

	<h2>Solution</h2>
	<p>Give each congress person a massive bonus if they balance the budget - their base salary as a bonus reward.  So if the base salary is $170,000 -  they would receive an additional 170,000 if and only if the budget is balanced.  If they are one $1 over budget, then they only receive their base budget, period.  Hopefully this incentive will inspire our politicians into triming our national budgets and look for more affordable ways to meet our national priorities.  Spending 100-200 million extra on salaries is a small price if it can prevent trillions of extra debt.
