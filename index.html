	<h1>Budget Balance Incentive</h1>
	</br>

	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<p>
		The United States of America is over 28 trillion in debt!  This level of debt is increasing and threatens our country into becoming insolvent.  Even now our nation could be considered the poorest country in world history - no other country has ever been 28 trillion dollars in debt!
	</p>
	</br>

	<h2>Solution</h2>
	<p>Give each Congress person a massive bonus if they balance the budget, using their base salary as a means of calculating a bonus reward.  In other words, if their base salary is $170,000, they would receive an additional $170,000 when and only when the budget is balanced.  If they are one $1 over budget, they receive their base budget.  Hopefully, this incentive will inspire our politicians to trime our national budget and look for more affordable ways to meet our national priorities.  Spending 100-200 million extra on salaries is a small price if it can prevent trillions of extra debt.
